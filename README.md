# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis
Purpose of analysis:
Students are sent to school to gain skills in various academic subjects. For the most part students are expected to gain math and reading skills at a minimum. These are the skills that will be most needed when students enter the workforce. The school district is interested in analyzing whether students are gaining the skills they need for success. If they are not gaining these skills it is necessary to understand what could be hindering this success. The following analysis will delve into the effect that school size and budget play in math and reading scores for students. 

# Results

* How is the district summary affected?

Original district summary

New district summary

In looking at these two images it is clear to see that there is not much variance between the summary where the ninth grade scores are removed for Thomas High School. The formatting is different so that the numbers may not be rounded but the overall results are almost spot on.

New school summary

There is not much difference between these two summaries besides the missing spending range per student. This is a great addition to the Dataframe so it would have been beneficial to have in both summaries. 

* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Thomas High School scores without 9th grade

By removing the 9th grade scores we see that the overall passing average for Thomas High School did go down 0.31%. In terms of the analysis this does not raise too much alarm becuase it did not change the average even an entire percentage point. There is a possibility that the grades were tampered with but if that is the case the results are not worth the effort. 

* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

  * Math and reading scores by grade

![](https://github.com/lightbright832/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/New%20Thomas.png)

There are differences observed in the scores by grade because without the 9th grade scores there is a slight variation in the averages and overall scores that are realized for Thomas High School. While the difference isn't great there is an obvious difference.

  * Scores by school spending

![](https://github.com/lightbright832/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/New%20Spending%20Summary.png)

The differences that are obvious between these two images is that the new summary does not have the scores rounded where as they were in the first summary. The values are very close and would be the same if the rounding had been applied in the same manner.

  * Scores by school size

![](https://github.com/lightbright832/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Original%20Size%20Summary.png)

![](https://github.com/lightbright832/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/New%20Size%20Summary.png)

Again these images represent similar averages with the only difference being the rounding that did not occur. Ultimately these figures represent the same averages.

  * Scores by school type
