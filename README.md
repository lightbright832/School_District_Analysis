# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis
Purpose of analysis:
Students are sent to school to gain skills in various academic subjects. For the most part students are expected to gain math and reading skills at a minimum. These are the skills that will be most needed when students enter the workforce. The school district is interested in analyzing whether students are gaining the skills they need for success. If they are not gaining these skills it is necessary to understand what could be hindering this success. The following analysis will delve into the effect that school size and budget play in math and reading scores for students.

In looking at these two images it is clear to see that there is not much variance between the summary where the ninth grade scores are removed for Thomas High School. The formatting is different so that the numbers may not be rounded but the overall results are almost spot on.

There is not much difference between these two summaries besides the missing spending range per student. This is a great addition to the Dataframe so it would have been beneficial to have in both summaries. 

* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
